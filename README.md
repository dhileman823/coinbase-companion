Setup recurring buy orders for Coinbase Pro

Transaction fees for standard Coinbase recurring buy orders are too expensive. Coinbase Pro fees are much more reasonable, but recurring buy orders are not offered. This application allows setting up recurring buys for Coinbase Pro by combining a custom user interface with the Coinbase Pro API, and scheduled Firebase cloud functions.
